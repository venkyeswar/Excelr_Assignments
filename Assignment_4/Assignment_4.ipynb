    "# Task 1: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "## Problem Statement: \n",
    "Bombay hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England. The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation W = $1,000 + $5X, where X represents the number of units produced in a week. Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective: \n",
    "To investigate the restaurant owners claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Given data:\n",
    "Equation given by Model W=$1000 + $5*X\n",

    "Sample mean Weekly Cost = 3,050\n",

    "no of samples (n) = 25\n",

    "No.of Units produced in a week (X) is a normal distribution and mean is 600 units and standard deviation is 25 units\n",

    "# Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data, hypothesis testing is basically an assumption that we make about the population parameters.\n",
